      <h2>What is Computer Vision?</h2>
      <p>Computer vision is a field of AI where machines are trained to understand images and videos, just like humans do. It's behind facial recognition, medical imaging, self-driving cars, and much more.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Imagine an app that can spot a brain tumor in seconds or a camera that helps the blind “see” using audio. That’s computer vision. It’s not just technology, it’s real-world impact.</p>

      <blockquote>“When machines learn to see, they help us see further. Becoming our Third Eye”</blockquote>
